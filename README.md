The Shut The Box program is brought to you for the purpose of pure enjoyment. With a little skill and some luck of the dice you can shut the box! The program was made with the Python coding language. To run it you need to make sure you have the Python 3. To check on a Mac op the terminal and type '~ % python3 --version'. To check on Windows, in command prompt or Windows Power Shell type 'python -V'. If it returns that its not installed download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Open with the terminal or VSCode and run the main.py file to launch the app. The rules for the game are available in the main menu prompt. The whole program is in a loop if you win or loose the game will restart from the menu. You can quit from the main menu.
