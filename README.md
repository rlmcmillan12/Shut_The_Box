# SHUT THE BOX

By: Ryan McMillan

The Shut The Box program is brought to you for the purpose of pure enjoyment. With a little skill and some luck of the dice you can shut the box! The program was made with the Python coding language. To run it you need to make sure you have the Python 3. To check on a Mac op the terminal and type '~ % python3 --version'. To check on Windows, in command prompt or Windows Power Shell type 'python -V'. If it returns that its not installed download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Open with the terminal or VSCode and run the main.py file to launch the app.

The rules for the game are available in the main menu prompt. The whole program is in a loop if you win or loose the game will restart from the menu. You can also quit from the main menu. Each turn starts with a roll. After the user inputs for a roll you are returned with the roll total. You are instructed to remove, or cover, the numbers left that add up to the total of the roll. The user keeps rolling till all the numbers are covered or the numbers cannot be covered by the dice roll.

The game is pretty unstable. If the user enters something other than a number to cover it shuts the program down. The user can also cover a number that is already covered to complete the turn. There is also no The main algorithm checks the roll against the numbers still uncovered. It will determine if a number or numbers can be removed with the current roll.
